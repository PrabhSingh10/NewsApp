//Repository is a class which purpose is to provide a clean API for accessing data.
//What that means is that the Repository can gather data from different data sources(different
//REST APIs, cache, local database storage) and it provides this data to the rest of the app.
//The other components donâ€™t know where the data comes from, they just consume it. It also
// serves as a single source of truth. Its role is to keep the local database up to date
//with the newest fetched data from remote service so that the application can still provide
//its functionalities with bad Internet connection or no connection at all.
